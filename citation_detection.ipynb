      "\t\t\t2. Conciseness. 3. Positiveness. ART. 1. Intelligibility and particularity. Every pleading must be sufficiently definite and cer- tain in its statements to make the precise nature of the charge or defense apparent to the court and to the adverse party. (Code, § 160.) Intelligibilitly.]-Pleadings must therefore be intelligi- ble, as much under the new system as under the former. (Boye v. Brown, sp. t., 3 How. 391; asf'd, 7 Barb. 80.) They are expressly required by the Code to be couched in plain and ordinary language. (Code, Q§ 142, 149, 153.) Particularity.]-Pleadings must, in order to be \"cer- tain,\" give sufficient particulars of the transactions stated to enable the adverse parties to identify the circum- stances. For this purpose, several descriptive allegations are required, which, though they cannot be made the subject of an issue, and are not strictly material to the cause of action, are nevertheless necessary to identify the precise claim or defense set up. Time.]-Thus the time at which a transaction occurred ought to be stated (Chesbrotugl v. N. Y. & Erie .R. R. Co., sp. t., 26 Barb. 9; 13 How. 557; BlanlMa rd v. Strait, sp. t., 8 How. 83); or, if a large number of transactions are included in the statements of a pleading, it should show within what period they all occurred. (1'arcy v. Lee, sp. t., 10 Abb. 143.) But the pleader will not be bound at the trial to prove that the event occurred at the time alleged. (Lester v. Jewvett, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 460; LAjon v. Clark, 8\n",
      "\t\t\t. Y. [4 Seld.] 157; Potter v. Thompson, 22 Barb. 89; Walden v. Crafts, 2 Abb. 302; S. 0., 4 E. D. Smith, 490;\n",

      "\t\t\tIf the only aspect in which a date is important is to show whether a certain event was prior or subsequent to another, it is sufficient to state that the one was prior to the other, without specifying dates. (Martin v. Eanouse, 2 Abb. 330; see Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 id. 286.)\n",
      "\t\t\tIf a good reason is shown for the pleader's inability to fix upon the date, he is excused from doing so. Thus, where he had lost a deed executed to him, he was relieved from the necessity of showing its date. (Kellogg v. Baker, sp. t., 15 Abb. 286.)\n",
      "\t\t\tPlace.]-Under the old system of pleading it was also necessary to state the place at which any material fact occurred, but this degenerated into a mere form which is entirely obsolete. It is now necessary to state the place at which an event took place, only when without such description the transaction might be difficult to identify.\n",
      "\t\t\tIn some cases an averment of place is actually a material issue. Thus, in an action on a contract void by the law of our state, it is material to show that it was made in a state where such contracts are by law valid (lhatc7er v. Morris, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.] 440), and so in suing under a statute applicable only to this state, the complaint must not leave it doubtful whether the transaction occurred within the state or not (Beach v. Bay State Co., 10 Abb. 71; 30 Barb. 433; 6 Abb. 415), and in pleading performance of an act required to be done at a particular place, the place of performance must be alleged. (Ferner v. Williams, 14 Abb. 215; U. S. Banik v. Smith, 11 Wheat. 171; Saul v. Jones, 1 El. & El. 59.)\n",
      "\t\t\tQuantity.]-In regard to averments of quantities and amounts, the only test to be applied is: are such aver- ments, in the particular case in hand, necessary to make the pleading specific?\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\tparticularity. Value. her particulars.\n",
      "\t\t\tYalue.]-In general, some statement of the value of a thing in controversy is necessary, as a matter of descrip- tion, in all actions brought for the recovery of money. Bat, except in an action on contract for the recovery of the reasonable price of a thing (Gregory v. Wright, sp. t., 11 Abb. 417), averments of value are not issuable. (Hackett v. Richards, 3 E. D. Smith, 13; Connoss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 315; see Woodruff v. Cook, 25 Barb. 510; over- ruling, in effect, Archer v. Boudinet, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 373.) Otherlparticulars.]-Whatever particulars, besides those mentioned, may be necessary to prevent surprise at the trial, or to protect parties from injustice or fraud, should be stated. Thus, in every case in which a claim is founded upon instruments for the payment of money, they should be separately described, so far as to identify them, and pre- vent the possibility of a recovery at the trial upon instru- ments not in the possession of the claimant at the com- mencement of the action. (Gray v. Kendall, 5 Bosw. 666; 10 Abb. 66.) Excessive particularity not required.]-Pleadings are not required to give all the details of the transactions to which they relate. If they clearly apprise the parties of the precise nature and extent of the charge or defense, and enable them to prepare for trial, nothing more can be required. (Sloman v. Schmidt, 8 Abb. 5; McKinney v. MelKinneey, sp. t., 12 How. 22.) Thus, in an action for money collected by the defend- ants as agents for the plaintiffs, the complaint need not state in detail the precise claims upon which the defend- ants collected the money. (Slonan v. Schmidt, supra.) Less particularity is required concerning facts best known to the adverse party.]-This was an established rule under the old system of pleading (Stephen on PlMd. 370; Van\n",
