Bat, except in an action on contract for the recovery of the reasonable price of a thing (Gregory v. Wright, sp. t., 11 Abb. 417), averments of value are not issuable. (Hackett v. Richards, 3 E. D. Smith, 13; Connoss v. Meir, 2 E. D. Smith, 315; see Woodruff v. Cook, 25 Barb. 510; over- ruling, in effect, Archer v. Boudinet, sp. t., Code Rep. N. S. 373.) Otherlparticulars.]-Whatever particulars, besides those mentioned, may be necessary to prevent surprise at the trial, or to protect parties from injustice or fraud, should be stated. Thus, in every case in which a claim is founded upon instruments for the payment of money, they should be separately described, so far as to identify them, and pre- vent the possibility of a recovery at the trial upon instru- ments not in the possession of the claimant at the com- mencement of the action. (Gray v. Kendall, 5 Bosw. 666; 10 Abb. 66.) Excessive particularity not required.]-Pleadings are not required to give all the details of the transactions to which they relate. If they clearly apprise the parties of the precise nature and extent of the charge or defense, and enable them to prepare for trial, nothing more can be required. (Sloman v. Schmidt, 8 Abb. 5; McKinney v. MelKinneey, sp. t., 12 How. 22.) Thus, in an action for money collected by the defend- ants as agents for the plaintiffs, the complaint need not state in detail the precise claims upon which the defend- ants collected the money. (Slonan v. Schmidt, supra.) Less particularity is required concerning facts best known to the adverse party.]-This was an established rule under the old system of pleading (Stephen on PlMd. 370; Van\n",

      "\t\t\tConciseness. Repetition not allowed. Remedy against error. Conciseness.]-Facts should be stated in a simple, though logical form, and in as few words as possible. For the sake of conciseness, the courts permit a mode of pleading not strictly regular, as for instance, aver- ments of law and fact intermingled, or argumentative allegations, where pure allegations of fact would lead to great prolixity. (See ante, Ip. 12.) Rel)etition Lot allowed.]-Pleadings must not repeat the same facts, even under a different form. A complaint or counterclaim is not allowed to set forth a single cause of action in several counts. (Fern v. Va(nderbilt, sp. t., 13 Abb. 72; Nash v. M'Cauley, sp. t., 9 id. 159; Dickens v. y. Y. Central R. R. Co., 13 How. 228; Sipperly v. Troy & Boston R. R. Co., 9 id. 83; Ford v. (Mattice, sp. t., 14 id. 91; Whittier v. Bates, sp. t., 2 Abb. 477; Dunning v.

The deci- sions are uniformly to the same effect, with the excep- tion of two cases (Birdseye v. Smith, 32 Barb. 217; Jones v. Palmer, sp. t., 1 Abb. 442), where, on account of peculiar circumstances, which made it difficult for the plaintiffs to rely upon a single form of statement, double counts were allowed. These last decisions were however erroneous. It is impossible that such a form of pleading can be true, and it is clearly repetitious. The only legiti- mate relief that can be afforded to a pleader embarrassed by uncertainty as to his facts, is to allow him to plead in a hypothetical or alternative form. That is sometimes necessary, but two counts upon the same cause of action are never necessary. Remedy against error.]-Superfluous matter may be stricken out on motion, as irrelevant or redundant. (Code, l160.) And this is the only proper remedy in such cases. No demurrer will lie on this ground (Meyer v. Vanc Collen, 28\n",

Every pleading must be sufficiently definite and cer- tain in its statements to make the precise nature of the charge or defense apparent to the court and to the adverse party. (Code, § 160.) Intelligibilitly.]-Pleadings must therefore be intelligi- ble, as much under the new system as under the former. (Boye v. Brown, sp. t., 3 How. 391; asf'd, 7 Barb. 80.) They are expressly required by the Code to be couched in plain and ordinary language. (Code, Q§ 142, 149, 153.) Particularity.]-Pleadings must, in order to be \"cer- tain,\" give sufficient particulars of the transactions stated to enable the adverse parties to identify the circum- stances. For this purpose, several descriptive allegations are required, which, though they cannot be made the subject of an issue, and are not strictly material to the cause of action, are nevertheless necessary to identify the precise claim or defense set up. Time.]-Thus the time at which a transaction occurred ought to be stated (Chesbrotugl v. N. Y. & Erie .R. R. Co., sp. t., 26 Barb. 9; 13 How. 557; BlanlMa rd v. Strait, sp. t., 8 How. 83); or, if a large number of transactions are included in the statements of a pleading, it should show within what period they all occurred. (1'arcy v.
